####Feature Selection 

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:

'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

	tBodyAcc-XYZ 
	tGravityAcc-XYZ 
	tBodyAccJerk-XYZ 
	tBodyGyro-XYZ 
	tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ 
	tBodyAccMag 
	tGravityAccMag 
	tBodyAccJerkMag 
	tBodyGyroMag 
	tBodyGyroJerkMag 
	fBodyAcc-XYZ 
	fBodyAccJerk-XYZ 
	fBodyGyro-XYZ 
	fBodyAccMag 
	fBodyAccJerkMag 
	fBodyGyroMag 
	fBodyGyroJerkMag 

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

	mean(): Mean value
	std(): Standard deviation
	mad(): Median absolute deviation 
	max(): Largest value in array
	min(): Smallest value in array
	sma(): Signal magnitude area
	energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
	iqr(): Interquartile range 
	entropy(): Signal entropy
	arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
	correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
	maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
	meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
	skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
	kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
	bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
	angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

	gravityMean
	tBodyAccMean
	tBodyAccJerkMean
	tBodyGyroMean
	tBodyGyroJerkMean

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in ['features.txt'](https://github.com/manazevedof/GettingAndCleaningData/blob/master/features.txt "Features")

### Building a new tidy data set:

The script *run_analisys.R* produces a tidy data set after processing records of eight different sets of data:

1. Label files
	- **activity_labels.txt:** a [6 x 2] table representing the activitiesâ€™ numbers and names.
	- **features.txt:** a [561 x 2] table with the 561 variable names, representing the different measures done in the experiment.

2. Test files
	- **subject_test.txt:**
	- **X_test:**
	- **y_test:**

3. Train files
	- **subject_train.txt:**
	- **X_train:**
	- **y_train:**

##Data dictionary

#### The new data set is composed by:

- 4 columns -> variable, activity, subject and mean.
- 11880 rows -> 66 variables * 6 activities * 30 subjects

**variable:** the selected variable from the original data sets.
